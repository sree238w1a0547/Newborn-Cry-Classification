# Newborn Cry Classification and Home Care Assistant
# Description
This project is a machine learning–based application designed to analyze newborn baby cry audio and identify the possible reason for crying. By using audio signal processing and a trained classification model, the system categorizes different types of cries and provides safe, general home-care suggestions to assist parents and caregivers.
# Technologies used
The project is developed using Python as the primary programming language. It uses Librosa for audio processing and MFCC feature extraction, Scikit-learn for training the Random Forest classification model, NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Gradio to create an interactive web-based user interface.
# How to run
To run the project, first clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. Install the required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file. After installing the dependencies, run the application file to launch the Gradio interface. Once the interface is running, upload a baby cry audio file in .wav format to receive the predicted cry type along with the corresponding home-care recommendations.
